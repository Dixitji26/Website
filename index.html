                <h3>Estimation of Soil Macronutrients Using Voting Classifier</h3>
                <p class="description">To adopt a proper fertilizer management strategy, estimation of the nutrient contents of agricultural soil is a primary task. Several models based on machine learning techniques have been suggested for this purpose. However, these models are suffering from some major limitations.</p>
                <span class="more-text">This paper suggests a better alternative model where a classier assembly has been hybridized with voting classifiers to achieve the accuracy better than any other existing model. Both hard and soft voting techniques were used in designing the model. The model has been trained and tested with benchmarked datasets. The performance of the model has been evaluated in terms of five standard popular classification metrics. A comparative analysis of performance reveals that to date, our proposed model is the best performing one for the estimation of macronutrients in agricultural soil</span>

                <h3>EdgeSAGE: Leveraging Edge Features for Enhanced Node Classification in Graph Neural Networks</h3>
                <p class="description">Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely
                    applied in the semi-supervised node classification task, where a
                    key point lies in sufficiently leveraging the limited but valuable
                    edge information. Most of the classical GNNs solely use the
                    known node features and labels for computing the classifica-
                    tion loss at the output.</p>
                <span class="more-text"> This paper presents an edge-enhanced
                    learning framework based on a graph sampling aggregation
                    (GraphSAGE) network. The proposed EdgeSAGE model (Edge
                    Sampling aggregation) manually generates edge features for
                    homogeneous graphs(citation graph) leveraging the use of edges
                    in all graph analysis tasks (node classification, Link prediction,
                    etc.) that remain uncharted in previous state-of-the-art models.
                    Moreover, a training and testing node selection technique is pro-
                    vided to eliminate the potential over-fitting issue and guarantee
                    the modelâ€™s generalization ability, providing multiple instances.
                    A modified inductive approach for a single graph dataset is
                    incorporated to generate a predictive model. Experimental results
                    on several real-world datasets demonstrate our approach can
                    consistently outperform other state-of-the-art modules in the
                    proposed node classification problem.</span>
